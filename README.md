# **STATS220 REPO**

***Website***: [Stats220](https://samchen0508.github.io/stats220/)
## 1. INTRODUCTION:
*Stats220 Repository is a public repository that everyone interested in that course or R language is welcome! I was hoping you could have a look at the R programs I have created and the meme images made by me; importantly, have a look at the R code; it is fun! Last but not least, there will be more stuff coming out in the near future! Enjoy!!!*
## 2. PURPOSE:
*The purpose of creating such a public repository is not only for me to store the materials I learnt from that course but as a shared platform for others to look at my works and probably gain knowledge or inspiration from them. It is a place with the purpose of double helping!*
